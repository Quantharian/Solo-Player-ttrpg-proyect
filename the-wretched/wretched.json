      "prompt": "After days of trying you have finally managed to repair your distress beacon and activate it.",
      "instructions": "Pull from the tower. Do not discard this card - instead, put it to one side and place 10 tokens on it. At the end of each day, after recording your log, roll your die. On a result of 6, remove a token from the card. If you successfully remove all the tokens, someone responds to your beacon. Make a final pull from the tower. If the tower stands, you are rescued and the game ends. Record one more audio log as you watch them destroy the creature and dock with your ship. If the tower falls, they arrived too late to stop your ship falling apart in the black.  You are dead, and the game is over."

How do you react to this?",
